title: Bermuda Grass Lawn - MOC
---

I am making this because I am first time homeowner and have no idea how to take care of a lawn. I also really dislike yard work.

So I decided to just try and get super nerdy by researching lawn care. It's definitely gotten me way more interested in it. This Map-of-Content (MOC) will be my collected notes on the subject. We have a house in North Georgia that has bermuda grass.

### Mowing
* ==You should never cut more than 1/3 of your grass at a time.==
* Ideal height for bermuda grass is between 0.5 and 1.5 inches. [Source](https://sodsolutions.com/lawn-care-guides/spring-maintenance-tips-for-your-bermuda-grass-lawn/) - Another place says between 1 and 2 inches. So I'd say 1.5 inches should be what I'm aiming for. [Source](https://www.walterreeves.com/lawn-care/bermudagrass-mowing-correctly/)
> There are many ways to measure lawn height. The simplest method is to take a measuring stick and measure from the ground to the surface of the grass blade. Do this multiple times throughout your lawn to get a good average. (This will also tell you where your [grass grows](https://obsessedlawn.com/how-long-does-grass-seed-take-to-grow/) slower or faster.)

### Watering
* Bermuda grass should get at least 1 inch of water a week during the growing season. If that comes from rain then you are fine and don't need to water.
* Without a sprinkler system you can just use a hose and a spray nozzle at the end.

### Fertilizing
> ==The most efficient way to fertilize is to use one of the dry granular fertilizers that are sold in 10-50 lb bags. Hose end liquid fertilizers work, but they are difficult to use correctly and you will need to fertilize twice as often as with granular fertilizer.== [Source](https://www.outsidepride.com/seed/grass-seed/bermuda-grass-seed/Fertilizing-Bermuda-Grass/)

* When possible use a slow release fertilizer with a 3-1-2 ratio. An example would be 12-4-8.
* [This](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Scotts-Wizz-Spreader-71131/206601107?ITC=AUC-129461-23-12140) is a good handheld fertilizer spreader which should be fine for our small yard.
* The best time to apply fertilizer is after the danger of frost has passed and ==your lawn is at least 50% green.==[[How To Properly Fertilize Bermuda Grass Lawns#^f7b63s|*]]


### Weeds
* Get a weed puller to get out the dandelions. When they are uprooted they do not grow back.
> **The best way to get rid of dandelions without killing grass** is to pull them out manually. It should be done before the flowers turn into seeds. When the earth has been moistened with rain, the best time to proceed.
