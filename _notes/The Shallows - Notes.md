title: The Shallows - Notes

These are my random notes from reading [[The Shallows]] by Nicholas Carr. I'll just write out my notes as I'm reading the book.

I just started the book and I am already loving it.

Nicholas Carr is starting the book by setting up the science and development of the plasticity of the brain. For a long time the science believed that the brain was like cement: it starts out malleable, but soon becomes rigid and doesn't change.

Eventually studies were done that discovered that we could create new neural pathways with repeated processes. 

One interesting study, and I'm pulling this from my memory so I may leave out details, had two groups of people in front of a keyboard. One group was playing the keyboard and the second group was just imagining themselves playing a piece on the keyboard. The results showed the brain activity between the two was virtually identical.

It's crazy to think that even thinkning about something can change how our brain works. This reminds me of the multitude of times when Jesus would say that thinking about the act of a sin was as bad as actually doing it. Did he know something we didn't for several thousand years? Well, depending on what you believe the answer is different. I believe yes.
